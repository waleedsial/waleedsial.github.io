# Linear Regression : What, why & How ?

Linear regression is a statistical method which we employ to model a relationship between variables. We shall take a simple example of housing prices where we have a general idea that if a house is bigger than its price will be higher than other houses given all other factors remain constant.

```python
# One general purpose gradient descent, both regression and classification tasks use same gradient descent function.
# Algorithms are differentiated based on activation.

```
