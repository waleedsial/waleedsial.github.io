# Linear Regression : What, why & How ?

Linear regression is a statistical method which we employ to model a relationship between variables. We shall take a simple example of housing prices where we have a general idea that if a house is bigger than its price will be higher than other houses given all other factors remain constant.

It would be beneficial for us if we can model this relationship between size & price of a house. The benefit will be manifold. Therefore, this covers the what & why part. In short, linear regression is statistical modelling technique which can be used to model, predict & quantify relationship between different variables.

How is this done ?
This itself requires a blog post of its own. Let us take a layman approach to understand this & discuss the gruesome details in another post.

How would a layman will approach this problem ?
Lets say if I am an investor & I would like to buy houses that I think can give me some profit. Let us say that we have only one feature for now as
size of the house. We also assume that we don't have any idea about relationship between size & price of a house.
We will see the size of the houses & their past prices. Using this, we can make a guess about the price of a house & make a decision to buy it.
Now in the start, it is possible that actual price is different & we lose some potential income or lose some investment.
With time, we will try to change our guess so that it becomes closer to actual selling price. With time, we become good at it.
This is what at a very high level any Optimization looks like & gradient descent is an optimization method which we use to model linear relationships.



A word of caution, humans make complex decisions fairly easy, machines don't. They have to learn !







```python
# One general purpose gradient descent, both regression and classification tasks use same gradient descent function.
# Algorithms are differentiated based on activation.

```
